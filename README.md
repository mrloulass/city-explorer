## Overview

The App will allow user to explore a city by retrieving information about that city.

## Getting Started

To run this app we will need to use LocationIQ API key in a `.env` file to run this app on your local machine.

## Architecture

[React](https://reactjs.org/)

[React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

[LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/)

We are using React language to build the app. React-bootstrap for styling, Axios for requesting from the API LocationIQ.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
